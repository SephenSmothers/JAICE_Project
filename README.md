# JAICE

Running the project:

Open the terminal and run:

Local Dev Server -> npm run dev
* This is a less strict run of the app changes in files immediately update to the local browser, great for iterative adjustments.

Production Ready Builds -> npm run build 
* I personally find this great for finding and correcting build errors becuase it's strict and will point out unused imports and variables.

Deployment Testing -> npm run start
* Production environmnet launch. Runs after build, and shows the final product.


The project has been set up with tailwindcss added.
